# node-cosm

Cosm is the new name for Pachube.

"Connect devices and apps on the Cosm platform, exchange data and ideas with
developers, and bring smart products to the world."

# Install

    $ npm install cosm

# Use

```javascript

    var cosm = require('cosm');
        client = new cosm.Cosm('insert API key here'),
        feed = new cosm.Feed(cosm, {id: 12345}),
        stream = new cosm.Datastream(client, feed, {id: 1})

    stream.addPoint(1.234); // Adds a data point with the timestamp now

    // Creates a datapoint at a specific timestamp
    stream.addPoint(2.345, new Date(2012, 11, 11, 11, 11);

    // Creates a datapoint now, with a callback - this API will likely change to
    // be a bit nicer to use.
    stream.addPoint(3.456, undefined, function () {
        console.log("Point added...");
    });
```

You can also create feeds, list existing feeds, add streams to a feed, and list streams associated with a feed:

    client.create({ }, function(err, id) {
      if (err) return ...;
      
      feed2 = new cosm.Feed(cosm, { id: id });

      feed2.get(function(err, data) {
        if (err) return ...;

        // data is a json representation of the stream, including datastream metadata (if any)
        data.datastreams = data.datastreams || [];
      });

      feed2.addStream({ id: 2 }, function(err, body) {
        if (err) return ...;

        // body is presently null
      });
    });

    client.list({ /* query parameters, if any */ }, function(error, json) {
      if (err) return ...;
      
      // json is the metadata for the stream
    });



## READ THIS

You can queue data to be uploaded, by setting the queue_size for the Datastream, the
API will only push data to Cosm when the queue is full.


```javascript
    var stream = new cosm.Datastream(client, feed, {id: 1, queue_size: 20});
```
The queue_size defaults to 1, so data is pushed as it's added.
